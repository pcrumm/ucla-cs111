Current Concerns and Limitations:

- Should newlines be copied into expressions or simply replaced with spaces?

- Consecutive '(' tokens will not parse properly, however, the lab spec
  indicates don't-care behavior for such cases, so the issue won't be fixed
  unless needed. Consecutive ')' tokens cause no known issues.
