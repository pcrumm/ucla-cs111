Lab 1C Time Travel Shell

Current Concerns and Limitations:

- Consecutive '(' tokens will not parse properly, however, the lab spec
  indicates don't-care behavior for such cases, so the issue won't be fixed
  unless needed. Consecutive ')' tokens cause no known issues.

- Any semicolon (';') found outside of a subshell is treated as if a new
  line was found (ie the two expressions were separated by new lines).
  Thus the semicolon does not find it's way into the parsed tree. If,
  however, a semicolon is found in any level of nested subshells, it is
  parsed along inside the command tree as a sequence command.

- If an error occurs while waiting on children in Time Travel mode, the
  code will ignore it until it loops around and tries to wait on the pid
  again. If for some unknown reason waiting on a specific pid with the
  WNOHANG option fails every single time, our shell will be stuck in an
  infinite loop.
