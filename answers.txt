# EXERCISE 1: What method you used to make your peer download and upload
#    files in parallel?  (~1-3 sentences)

We decided to use forking to handle parellel uploads and downloads. The
client will fork once for each specified download, but if a fork fails
the client will NOT download the specified file, and should be run again.
We then use a blocking wait for all downloads to finish to reclaim any
resources before listening for other peers. For each connected peer we fork
a process and use non-blocking waits to reclaim any finished forked children.

# EXERCISE 2A: What conditions did you find and fix that would have
#    triggered a buffer overrun bug?  (~1-3 sentences each)

# EXERCISE 2B: What other robustness problems did you fix?  (~1-3 sentences
#    each)

# EXERCISE 3: Describe the attacks you implemented for "evil mode".  Why
#    are they attacks?  (~3-10 sentences each)

# Extra credit problems
#Extra credit problem: none

# Add any other information you'd like us to know below this line.
