This repository contains our project solutions for CS111. These solutions are published for reference only, and should not be used in whole or in part for your own coursework.

Paul Eggert's CS111 policies allow for work in partners for this class' projects. All projects completed by the following group:

* Phil Crumm <pcrumm@ucla.edu>
* Ivan Petkov <ipetkov@ucla.edu>

Each solution is published in its own independent branch for clarity.
